I am an engineering student at Mines Paris – PSL, currently pursuing a double degree with the National University of Engineering in Peru. My academic path is deliberately interdisciplinary: I initially studied International Business, which gave me a strong understanding of economic systems, organizations, and decision-making in complex environments. Over time, I realized I was more drawn to the technical side of problem-solving, which led me to transition into engineering and applied sciences.

Since then, my training has focused on engineering systems that interact with the real world—combining data, control, embedded technologies, and analytical thinking. I have worked on projects involving sensors, IoT architectures, system modeling, and control, where I particularly enjoy translating abstract theory into practical, robust solutions under real constraints.

Coming from Peru, a developing country facing significant infrastructure and mobility challenges, I am deeply motivated by projects with tangible impact. I am especially interested in environments where technology supports better decision-making, efficiency, and long-term sustainability, whether in infrastructure, industry, public systems, or large-scale operations.

I value clarity of thought, intellectual rigor, and ownership of problems. I am comfortable learning quickly, working across disciplines, and engaging with both technical and non-technical stakeholders. Ultimately, I seek roles where engineering, data, and real-world impact intersect.
